~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**** 1/14/2005 - I don't use APPGEN any more and don't have any
**** access to it either. The module is provided as is, if you want
**** to take over its maintaining/development please let me know.
*********************************************************************

This is DB::Appgen - low-level functions for APPGEN database
manipulations (you probably already know what appgen is if you loaded
this module, but if you don't please visit http://appgen.com/ - in short
it is the sytem behind these green salesman terminals you see in various
ikeas, sears and so on).

All this was made in about four hours including reading perlxstut
manpage, so do not expect something pretty. Although it appears to be
working OK in my tests.

I'll be doing some bigger data manipulations using this extension in the
next couple of days and I will probably build some kind of higher level
interface. If you don't see it on CPAN yet feel free to ask me about it.

INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

I failed to find a simple way in MakeMaker to give exact paths to
libraries, so you need to create directory somewhere and put (or better
symlink) the following files from your APPGEN developer kit into it
under the following names:

libappgen_appl.a -> APPL.a
libappgen_strings.a -> strings.a
libappgen.a -> appgen.a

Then you need to edit Makefile.PM and point $appgenlibdir variable to
your directory. Alternatively, just name (or sym-link) your directory
'appgen-libs' in the top distribution directory -- that's the default
name.

Yours,
Andrew
